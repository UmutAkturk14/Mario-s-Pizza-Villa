# Mario's Pizza Villa

Welcome to Mario's Pizza Villa - your favorite online pizzeria!

## Overview

Mario's Pizza Villa is a Ruby on Rails web application that serves as the online presence for our fictional pizzeria, "Mario's Pizza Villa." This platform allows users to explore our menu, place orders, and conveniently track the status of their orders. Additionally, it offers an admin dashboard with analytics and menu management capabilities.

**Note:** This project was completed within a 10-day challenge and is now **DISCONTINUED**. Credit for the admin dashboard goes to the creators of the [responsive dashboard layout](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/responsive-dashboard-layout), which served as the initial template. I made modifications to adapt it to the specific requirements of "Mario's Pizza Villa."

Feel free to fork or clone this repository for your own use. If you intend to use this project professionally, consider implementing Stripe checkout for payment processing to make it fully operational. With this addition, the project will be ready for seamless online pizza ordering. Happy coding and pizza-making!
